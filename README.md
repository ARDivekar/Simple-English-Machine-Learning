# About Simple English Machine Learning

This is a collection of notes, tools, tips and tricks on Machine Learning, 

I try my best to make concepts _intuitive_ and **explicit**. These notes might be detailed, but should be easy to follow. Some background reading might be required.

I will borrow from better writers at times. No need to re-write _The Odyssey_ every time.

I focus on Python, because it has the best ecosystem for Machine Learning and it is an easy language to learn.
